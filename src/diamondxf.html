			<h3>What happened to RoyalMatrix?</h3>
			<p>As the end of 2013 RoyalMatrix had decided he wanted to expand into the hosting business amongst other
			things and to this he decided to pass it onto a business partner who he knew well who had experience in
			server hosting and runs another network, but more importantly someone he can trust. Royal Matrix still is an 'active' admin on all the server and is around when and if he can be.</p>
			<h3>Who the hell is DiamondXF?</h3>
			<p>As of next week (second week of January) Me, DiamondXF will be hosting all of the GrimPvP/StaticMC servers on top of the range machines linked together, running in a server network to boost the power and performance of StaticMC under my very own hosting company, <a href="https://GalacticServers.com/">Galactic Servers</a> While bringing more power to your network. You will notice a massive improvement in the lag. I am admin because, one I work with the new owner of the network, MineReachMC and I provide the sponsored hosting services to MineReachMC and StaticMC. I am excellent support members and I am always up for a good chat if I am around, so don't be afraid to talk to me. </p>
