				<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<p>We may modify the Terms of Service from time to time and are not obligated to notify you. You should revisit these Terms on a regular basis as revised versions will be binding on you. Any such modification will be effective upon our posting of the new Terms. You understand and agree that your continued access to or use of the website and/or services after any posted modification to the Terms indicates your acceptance of the modification.</p>
			<h1>Service Termination And Suspension</h1>
			<p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend any service at any given time for any reason. Any void of the TOS or reason of choice by PPX Hosting may result in instant termination or suspension.</p>
			<h1>Disk Space</h1>
			<p>The unmetered disk space/usage we actively advertise as being part of our Minecraft hosting services does have restrictable limits. If your individual Minecraft server instance is using more than 60% of the total disk space, PPX Hosting is permitted to remove unnecessary files from the hard drive with or without notice. Unnecessary file types are determined by the discretion of PPX Hosting management. Disk space assigned for use via our web hosting or Minecraft hosting services are not to be used for unacceptable uses such as personal backups.</p>
			<h1>Data Transfer</h1>
			<p>In most cases, if you use our services consistently within the Terms of Service and these paragraphs, you will not need to worry about how much bandwidth your server is using. PPX Hosting will use its 3rd party monitoring software to monitor the amount of bandwidth each service uses. On a shared hosting plan, your bandwidth cannot exceed a total of 10TB per month. You will be charged the appropriate bandwidth overage fees if the limit is exceeded. PPX Hosting does not count bandwidth caused by unfiltered network attacks against you.</p>
			<h1>Server Abuse</h1>
			<p>Any attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server or customer of PPX Hosting is strictly prohibited. PPX Hosting will h4ly react to any use or attempted use of an Internet account or computer without the owner's authorization. Such attempts include "Internet scamming" (tricking other people into releasing their passwords), password theft, security hole scanning, etc. Any unauthorized use of accounts or computers by you, whether or not the attacked account or computer belongs to PPX Hosting, will result in action against you. Possible actions include warnings, account suspension or cancellation, as well as civil or criminal legal action, depending on the seriousness of the attack. IMPORTANT NOTE - PPX Hosting has the right to discontinue service, or deny access to anyone who violates our policies or the terms and conditions shown here WITHOUT WARNING or PRIOR NOTICE. No refunds of fees paid will be made if account termination is due to violation of the terms outlined within. You may not run IRC, bots or clients on shared servers. Unacceptable uses also include, but are NOT limited to: Bulk emailing, unsolicited emailing, newsgroup spamming, pornographic content, illegal content, copyright infringement, trademark infringement, warez sites (including links to/from), cracks, software serial numbers, proxy-relaying, link farming (the act of or by use of scripts), link grinding, link-only sites, spamdexing, FFA (Free-For-All) and/or anything else determined by PPX Hosting to be unacceptable use of our services including abuse of server resources. The severity of each abuse type is determined by the PPX Hosting Abuse Department. You will be notified via a support ticket about any abuse complaints originating from your IP address and your service may be suspended. In the event of a severe abuse complaint, you may be subject to an administrative fine or service termination.</p>

			<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
			<p>We operate a strict no refund policy. One you have paid for a server then that payment is final. This includes if you fail to cancel a recurring payment and it has past the day of payment Once the payment has gone through and the service you have purchased has been activated then no refunds can be given. You can always cancel before your next payment date or stop the recurring payment before the money goes out and no further action will be required. If you no longer need a services or which to change then we offer a credit refund policy. This allows users to switch at any time to another plan with their remaining credit and apply it the new service. However on dedicated servers there can be a 0-7 business working delay as we operate on a demand to supply ratio. Please not we cannot provide refunds on Dedicated servers due to the large amount of expenditure required to run the systems. Once the payment has been sent it would be processed through our systems and your hardware will be ordered within 7 working days. Due to the set up delay your billing cycle will not start until the hardware is running. To avoid any confusion we do not offer under any exception, refunds on dedicated servers.</p>
